# LIBERO Prompt Organization

## Purpose

This document describes how LIBERO prompts are assembled and how guide source
files are referenced by the active prompt.

It is intended for contributors who need to inspect or modify LIBERO prompt
behavior.

## Prompt Assembly Flow

The active prompt path is:

1. `rpent/cli/main.py` selects the environment spec and renders prompts.
2. `robots/libero/prompt_bundle.py` assembles the LIBERO prompt sections.
3. `robots/libero/prompts/system.py` defines the active LIBERO system prompt fragments.
4. `robots/libero/prompts/shared.py` defines shared guide-loading and runtime-adapter constants.
5. The rendered prompt is passed to the selected planner backend.

## Files and Responsibilities

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `prompt_bundle.py` | Returns the active LIBERO system and user prompt sections. |
| `prompts/system.py` | Defines `PREAMBLE`, `GOAL`, `RULES`, `LOCALIZATION`, `WORKFLOW`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `NEXT`, and `USER_MODE`. |
| `prompts/shared.py` | Defines shared constants such as `MCP_RUNTIME_ADAPTER` and `GUIDE_READ_INSTRUCTIONS`. |
| `guides/strict_hybrid_guide.md` | Guide source file for strict hybrid behavior. |
| `guides/pro_hybrid_guide.md` | Guide source file for PRO-specific guidance. |
| `guides/env_calibration.md` | Guide source file for environment calibration notes. |

## Guide Source Loading

The active prompt references guide source files through `GUIDE_READ_INSTRUCTIONS`.

`GUIDE_READ_INSTRUCTIONS` asks Claude Code to read these guide source files once
at the start of each run with the structured `Read` tool, before issuing the
first physical command:

```text
robots/libero/guides/strict_hybrid_guide.md
robots/libero/guides/pro_hybrid_guide.md
robots/libero/guides/env_calibration.md
```


## MCP Runtime Adapter

RPent uses structured runtime tools. Some guide content may include
legacy command examples or older command formats.

`MCP_RUNTIME_ADAPTER` is placed before guide-loading instructions so the active
prompt preserves guide strategy while using the current structured runtime tools.
Detailed runtime constraints, such as tool availability and forbidden legacy
paths, should stay in `prompts/system.py` and the guide-level runtime contract.

## Optional SAM3 Segmentation

The `segment` tool is an optional perception helper. `rpent/cli/main.py` does not
automatically start SAM3; the runtime `segment` tool only calls the service
configured by `SAM3_SERVER_URL`. When no segmentation service is configured,
`segment` returns a structured fallback so the agent can continue with image
inspection and `back_project`.

Start a SAM3-compatible segmentation service before running RPent, then
export its URL in the shell that launches RPent:

```bash
export SAM3_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8114
```

If SAM3 occupies a GPU, do not schedule LIBERO env jobs on that same GPU.
RPent's `SAM3_SERVER_URL` path uses a SAM3-compatible protocol
(`text_prompt` for `/segment` and `/segment_point` for point prompts).

When a matching world map artifact exists, `segment` writes collision-safe
`segment_NN_XX.json` artifacts with mask statistics and `world_xyz`; repeated
`segment()` calls on the same source step receive different `XX` indexes instead
of overwriting earlier evidence. If the world map is missing or the mask shape
does not match, the tool records a `world_error` instead of failing the episode.

See `scripts/sam3/README.md` for the optional pre-run SAM3 service setup helper.

## Safe Checklist for Prompt Changes

Before changing LIBERO prompts:

1. Confirm the active prompt path: `rpent/cli/main.py` -> `prompt_bundle.py` -> `prompts/system.py`.
2. Check which shared constants are imported by `prompts/system.py`.
3. Keep runtime-tool guidance before guide-source instructions.
4. Keep guide source paths and guide-level runtime contracts accurate.
5. Avoid changing unrelated prompt behavior in the same patch.
6. For static prompt changes, inspect the rendered prompt or grep the active prompt fragments before relying on the new path.
