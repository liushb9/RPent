1. READ MEMORY FIRST (operating wisdom — magic numbers + gotchas):
     `logs/memory/MEMORY.md`
   Scan it, then `Read` the 3-5 most relevant feedback_*.md for your cell.

""" + LIBERO_GUIDES + """
3. USE PAST EXPERIENCE AS A STRATEGY PRIOR (not as coords):
   - workspace_pro/results_object_pert/   and   primitives/results_all_object_new/
   - Pattern: recipe_<suite>_<pert>_t<N>_s0.jsonl + <...>.json audit.
   These recipes were built WITH oracle coords; their numbers are tuned for a
   DIFFERENT scene, so use them ONLY for STRATEGY (which object, prompt ladder,
   primitive sequence, offsets). Re-derive THIS scene's positions via the
   LOCALIZATION workflow above — never paste a recipe's coords.

4. INSPECT INITIAL STATE: Call `mcp__physical_agent__view_driver_state` with
   `{"step": 0}` OR read states.json[0] (object_names + eef pose),
   images_cam/image_cam_00.png, camera_meta.json. Identify the target object + goal region.

5. EXECUTE one primitive at a time by calling its MCP tool, e.g.:

       mcp__physical_agent__move_to({"xyz": [x, y, z], "gripper": -1, ...})
       mcp__physical_agent__pi0_pick({"prompt": "...", "track_obj": "...", ...})
       mcp__physical_agent__release({})

   Each MCP tool blocks until the next states.json entry, and returns the
   new state entry + log + images. Do NOT manually create driver command
   files; use MCP for every primitive. Then inspect the returned state +
   images_cam/image_cam_NN.png (+ back-project as needed),
   decide, repeat with NN=02, 03, ...

6. ALLOWED PRIMITIVES (physics-only; full schemas in STRICT_HYBRID_GUIDE):
   move_to, pi0_pick, pi0_doubled, release, set_gripper, rotate_wrist,
   rotate_pitch, move_pose.
   FORBIDDEN: reset, exit, set_object_pose, articulate_to, js_move_to, carry_object.

7. RECOVERY (no reset): re-localize (objects may have moved), re-pre-position +
   re-pi0_pick on the next prompt-ladder rung; split long traversals into <0.30
   xy waypoints; for a door/drawer/knob use a SHORT capped OSC push or pi0_doubled
   (never one long push — it NaNs MuJoCo). If genuinely unreachable, write an
   honest stuck-audit (libero_terminated:false) — never warp.

8. WHEN state.libero_terminated == True:
   a. Write the working command sequence to {{output_dir}}/recipe_{{recipe_tag}}.jsonl.
   b. Write audit {{output_dir}}/{{recipe_tag}}.json with: suite, task_id, seed,
      regime:"strict_perception", strategy_notes (incl. how you localized),
      pick_result, final_state (latest states.json entry's `state`), libero_terminated:true.
   c. Stop.
   If unrecoverable, write {{recipe_tag}}.json with libero_terminated:false +
   strategy_notes describing what you tried. Then stop.

PERCEPTION = """
MODE: PERCEPTION-ISOLATED — YOU DO NOT GET OBJECT WORLD COORDINATES

The state JSON only gives you object_names + robot proprioception (NO xyz
per object). You must LOCALIZE objects yourself via camera + depth:

  HOW TO GET AN OBJECT'S WORLD XYZ:
  1. Look at images_cam/image_cam_NN.png (calibration frame — the SECOND
     image returned by view_driver_state and by every primitive tool).
     Find the target object's pixel (row from top, col from left; image
     is 256×256).
  2. Call back_project(row, col) to back-project that pixel ->
     world_xyz using the metric depth at that pixel + camera_meta.
  3. Sample 3-5 pixels on the object and median their xy for robustness.
  4. For z (grasp height): sample the table surface next to the object
     (not the object itself). Then add ~0.02-0.05 m for pre-pos height.

  CRITICAL: images/image_NN.png is the Pi0 frame (180° rotated) — do NOT
  pick pixels from it for back-projection. Use images_cam/image_cam_NN.png
  ONLY.

  view_camera_meta() returns the calibration: intrinsics K (3×3),
  extrinsic cam->world (4×4), and the projection recipe.

  KNOWN TABLE HEIGHTS (sanity-check your back-projected z):
    • KITCHEN frame  (eef_z ≈ 1.17):  table ≈ 0.90 m
    • LIVING_ROOM    (eef_z ≈ 0.68):  table ≈ 0.42 m
    • Object scene   (eef_z ≈ 0.26):  table ≈ 0.05 m

ALWAYS verify your position by looking at images_cam/image_cam_NN.png after moving.
Apply manipulation offsets from memory (e.g. BOWL: eef_y = plate_y + 0.045).
"""

API_PERCEPTION_USER_CONTEXT = """
The env server is already running with --hide_object_coords. Its output
directory is {{output_dir}}. states.json (with step 0 entry) +
images/image_00.png + images_cam/image_cam_00.png + depths/depth_00.npy +
camera_meta.json are ready. Run `mcp_list_dir` to confirm.

You do NOT have GT object world coordinates. You must localize objects
via images_cam + depth + camera_meta + back_project (see the MODE section
at the top of your system prompt).

Goal: make state.libero_terminated == True via a strict_perception hybrid run.

Suggested first steps:
1. read_text_file("logs/memory/MEMORY.md")
2. Use the embedded guide sections already included in the system prompt.
3. view_camera_meta() — get the calibration matrices
4. view_driver_state(step=0) — see the initial scene (both images!)
5. Look at images_cam/image_cam_00.png; find the target object; back_project() its pixels
6. Plan; then call the primitive tools (move_to / pi0_pick / release /
   set_gripper / rotate_wrist / rotate_pitch / move_pose) repeatedly
   until libero_terminated=True
7. write_text_file the recipe + audit; finish(success)

You are an LLM-in-the-loop hybrid driver for the LIBERO PRO benchmark, running
in PERCEPTION-ISOLATED mode: you are NOT given object world coordinates. You
must localize objects yourself from the camera image + depth + calibration.

Pi0.5 loaded and a single-env LIBERO sim. It communicates with you via the
`physical_agent` MCP tools and writes artifacts in `{{output_dir}}/`:

- Call one of the per-primitive MCP tools (`mcp__physical_agent__move_to`,
  `mcp__physical_agent__pi0_pick`, `mcp__physical_agent__release`,
  `mcp__physical_agent__set_gripper`, `mcp__physical_agent__rotate_wrist`,
